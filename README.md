# Decentralized Retail Loss Prevention System

A blockchain-based platform for transparent, data-driven retail loss prevention and inventory security.

## Overview

The Decentralized Retail Loss Prevention System leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize how retailers track, manage, and prevent inventory shrinkage. By creating an immutable record of store verification, inventory reconciliation, incident reporting, and pattern analysis, this solution enables retailers to identify sources of loss, implement targeted interventions, and measure effectivenessâ€”all while ensuring data integrity and cross-location intelligence sharing.

## Core Smart Contracts

### Store Verification Contract
- Validates legitimate retail locations through secure authentication
- Maintains an immutable registry of authorized retail points
- Records store-specific attributes (size, format, risk profile)
- Manages access permissions for loss prevention personnel
- Tracks historical loss metrics by location
- Supports multiple store formats within retail chains
- Enables secure onboarding and offboarding of retail locations

### Inventory Reconciliation Contract
- Tracks discrepancies in stock levels across inventory cycles
- Records discrepancies between expected and actual inventory
- Identifies specific SKUs and departments with shrinkage issues
- Maintains chronological history of inventory variances
- Compares shrinkage patterns across different store locations
- Supports various inventory counting methodologies (cycle counts, full counts)
- Enables integration with point-of-sale and inventory management systems

### Incident Reporting Contract
- Documents theft or damage events with timestamp verification
- Records comprehensive details of loss incidents
- Stores evidence including security footage references and images
- Tracks incident response and resolution workflows
- Manages case documentation for law enforcement coordination
- Supports anonymous reporting options for employees
- Maintains privacy controls for sensitive incident information

### Pattern Analysis Contract
- Identifies trends requiring intervention through data analysis
- Correlates loss incidents with environmental and operational factors
- Detects unusual patterns across multiple locations or time periods
- Generates risk assessments for specific products, departments, or stores
- Evaluates effectiveness of loss prevention interventions
- Provides actionable intelligence for targeted prevention strategies
- Supports predictive analytics for proactive loss prevention
